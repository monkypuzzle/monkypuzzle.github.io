  <h1>Biography</h1>
  <hr class="thick" />

  <p class="biography-body"><strong>About a year and a half ago, I was working at a small startup in San Francicso.</strong> I did data processing work - punching in every day to punch keys. We were only about fifteen employees strong, and our humble data-processing team shared quarters with the web development team. Every day at work, I'd hear the dev team talk coding. As the weeks passed, I watched as they built up the product our company was founded to sell. It seemed pretty amazing - that this small team of coders, in short order, could create something virtual that offered real value to our customers.</p>
  <p class="biography-body"><strong>I ended up leaving the company to pursue what I thought I really wanted to do - study evolutionary biology.</strong> But by the time I'd had another couple of stints in the field - first in the Sierras, then in the Galapagos - I was sure that academic research wasn't in the cards. I'd never considered it when I was in San Francisco, but I started to think about it then - maybe, web development would be right for me. The fair-weather forecasts and the gainful salaries were pluses of course, but what really sold me on the idea was the nature of the discipline. Even in my biology jobs, I'd always been doing grunt work - collecting data for other peoples' projects. I liked the idea that with web development, I'd be thinking critically and applying my creativity daily. I liked the idea that I'd have to learn constantly. And I liked the idea that I could do something with real, demonstrable impact on the lives of people around me.</p>
  <p class="biography-body"><strong>I was relieved to discover that I really enjoyed coding.</strong> I enrolled in <a href="#"><mark>DevBootcamp</mark></a>, and I haven't looked back since. I'm still in the infancy of my web development career, but I've had a blast so far, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it'll take me. If you think you I might be a good fit for your company or your project, I'd love to hear from you!</p>
