    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr class="thick" />

    <p class="about-body"><strong>About a year and a half ago, I was working at a small startup in San Francicso, doing data processing work.</strong> Our small data-processing team shared quarters with the web development team, and every day at work, I'd hear them talk coding. As the weeks passed, I watched as they built our company's product. It seemed pretty amazing - that this small team of coders, in short order, could create something virtual that offered real value to our customers.</p>
    <p class="about-body">I ended up leaving the company to pursue what I thought I really wanted to do - study evolutionary biology. But by the time I'd had another couple of field stints, I was sure that academic research wasn't in the cards for me. So I started to think about web development. The fair-weather forecasts and the gainful salaries were pluses, of course, but what really sold me on the idea was the nature of the job. Even in my biology jobs, I'd always been doing grunt work - collecting data. I liked the idea that with web development, I'd be thinking critically and applying my creativity daily. I liked the idea that I'd have to learn constantly. And I liked the idea that I could build things with the potential to benefit the people around me.</p>
    <p class="about-body">I was relieved to discover that I really enjoyed coding. I enrolled in <a href="#"><mark>DevBootcamp</mark></a>, and I haven't looked back since. I'm still in the infancy of my web development career, but I've had a blast so far, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it'll take me. If you think you I might be a good fit for your company or your project, I'd love to hear from you!</p>
